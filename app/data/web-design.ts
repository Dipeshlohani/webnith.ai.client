export const webDesignFAQData = [
  {
    "question": "How much does a website cost?",
    "answer": "We scope the project first, then provide a fixed, itemized quote so you know exactly what's included. Most small-business websites land in the low-to-mid four figures, while highly custom builds cost more due to added strategy, UX/UI, and engineering time. Our basic website package starts at NZ$1,999. Extra features, integrations, content creation, or advanced SEO are priced as separate line items for your approval."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors affect the price?",
    "answer": "Price is driven by scope (pages and templates), design complexity (custom layouts, animation, brand depth), functionality (e-commerce, bookings, memberships, dashboards, integrations), content needs (copy, imagery, video), accessibility and SEO requirements, and timelines. More complexity and custom engineering generally increase cost. We'll review each requirement with you so the quote reflects your real needs—no surprises."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there ongoing costs?",
    "answer": "Yes. Expect recurring costs for domain registration and hosting, plus any optional maintenance or support plan. Hosting varies by provider and performance needs. Add-ons such as ongoing SEO, analytics, conversion optimization, or content support are available monthly or on demand. We'll clearly outline all recurring costs in your proposal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are domain registration and hosting included in the quoted price?",
    "answer": "No. Domain registration and hosting are not included by default. You own these services in your name. We can recommend providers, help you purchase and configure them correctly, or manage hosting as an add-on if you prefer a hands-off approach."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long will my project take?",
    "answer": "A typical small-business site takes about 3–4 weeks from kickoff to launch, assuming timely content delivery and feedback. Larger or highly custom builds (e.g., e-commerce, complex integrations, custom apps) usually take 8–12+ weeks. Your schedule depends on scope, the review cycle, and third-party dependencies. We'll share a clear plan with milestones and target dates."
  },
  {
    "question": "How involved do I need to be?",
    "answer": "We handle the heavy lifting. You'll provide goals, brand inputs, feedback on design and build reviews, and final content approvals. Staying responsive at key checkpoints keeps the project on schedule and ensures the finished site aligns with your vision."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who will be my point of contact?",
    "answer": "You'll have a dedicated project lead who coordinates designers, developers, and SEO specialists. We provide structured updates—weekly or milestone-based—so you always know what's done, what's next, and what we need from you."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the design custom or based on a template?",
    "answer": "Our designs are 100% custom—no off-the-shelf templates. We craft your site around your brand, audience, and goals. Custom design improves clarity of messaging, conversion rates, and long-term flexibility: we tailor layouts to your content strategy, build reusable components, and establish a visual language that's uniquely yours."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will the site be mobile-first and responsive?",
    "answer": "Yes. We design mobile-first and ensure full responsiveness across phones, tablets, and desktops. We test layouts, navigation, forms, and performance on modern browsers and common devices to deliver fast load times, readable typography, and frictionless interactions everywhere."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you add special features (e-commerce, bookings, memberships)?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. We implement online stores, subscriptions, bookings, gated content, member areas, custom dashboards, and third-party integrations (payments, CRMs, ERPs, marketing tools). We'll scope these features in your proposal, confirm any licensing or platform fees, and plan for future enhancements."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure the design fits our brand and customers?",
    "answer": "We begin with brand discovery (logo, colors, typography, tone of voice) and audience research (goals, objections, decision triggers). We review competitors and adjacent experiences, then collaborate with you through design reviews. The result is a UX/UI that clearly expresses your brand and guides customers to take action."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is logo design included in the website plan?",
    "answer": "No. Logo design is not included by default. Please provide your existing logo and brand assets. If you need a new or refreshed logo, we can quote a separate branding package."
  },
  {
    "question": "What CMS/tech stack do you recommend?",
    "answer": "We build a custom CMS tailored to your workflow, performance needs, and growth (typically using a modern React/Next.js front end with a secure backend). If you prefer an editor-friendly, off-the-shelf CMS, we can implement WordPress, Wix, or Shopify (for e-commerce). We'll walk you through the trade-offs—editing experience, customization limits, performance, security, and total cost of ownership—and set up the option that best fits your team. Training and documentation are included either way."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can my team edit the site ourselves?",
    "answer": "Yes. You'll receive editor/admin access to update copy, images, and pages without writing code. We include a live walkthrough and quick-start documentation so your team can confidently manage day-to-day updates after launch."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who handles domain and hosting?",
    "answer": "You own and control both. We can help you purchase and configure them, migrate from a previous provider, or offer managed hosting as an add-on if you want us to handle uptime, updates, and backups."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will the site be secure and use HTTPS (SSL)?",
    "answer": "Yes. We launch with an SSL certificate and follow security best practices, including updates, backups, and hardening. If you choose a maintenance plan, we'll continue to monitor and apply security updates to keep your site safe over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do we own the website after launch?",
    "answer": "Yes. You own your content, the custom code we create for you (excluding any third-party licensed components), and all delivered assets. At project close, we hand over admin access, credentials, and any relevant source files so you're in full control."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do we need to provide content and images?",
    "answer": "We provide the content and stock images as outlined in your plan. If you prefer, you can supply your own content and images."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the site SEO-friendly?",
    "answer": "Yes. We build on strong technical SEO foundations: clean information architecture, fast load times, semantic markup, structured headings, optimized images with alt text, and indexation basics. If you want to compete for specific keywords, we also offer ongoing SEO campaigns and content programs post-launch."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you offer maintenance and support after launch?",
    "answer": "Yes. We include a post-launch warranty window for snags and small refinements. For ongoing care, our optional plans cover updates, backups, security monitoring, minor enhancements, and priority support. You can also engage us ad hoc if you prefer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will you train our team?",
    "answer": "Yes. We provide a live training session, role-based access, and quick-start guides. If needed, we can record Loom tutorials or schedule refresher sessions later."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the site grow with us?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. We design modular components and an extensible architecture so you can add pages, features, or integrations without a full rebuild. Tell us about future plans and we'll bake scalability into the initial setup."
  },
  {
    "question": "Have you worked in our industry?",
    "answer": "Often, yes—but industry familiarity isn't required. Our discovery process gets us up to speed quickly, and we tailor UX/UI to your audience's language and decision criteria. We're happy to share relevant case studies and references."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should we choose the right agency?",
    "answer": "Look for a portfolio that reflects quality and versatility, transparent pricing, a clear process, strong communication, and a team that understands your goals. Start with a low-commitment discovery call to gauge fit, approach, and value."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I choose WordPress or a template-based builder, or use a modern stack like React?",
    "answer": "If you need a simple marketing site quickly and on a tight budget, WordPress or a template-based builder can be perfectly fine. If you want long-term flexibility, speed, and a custom experience that can grow with your business, a modern React stack—most often Next.js—is usually the better choice. React/Next.js offers excellent performance (SSR/SSG/ISR), cleaner integrations, a component system tailored to your brand, fewer plugin risks, and an editor-friendly setup when paired with a headless CMS. The trade-off is a higher initial build cost than a themed WordPress site, but you gain scalability, security, and control. At Webnith, we default to React/Next.js for performance and growth, but we're platform-agnostic and will recommend the best fit for your goals and budget."
